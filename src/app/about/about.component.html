    <h2>What is a Blog?</h2>
    <p>  Definition of blog
        A blog (shortening of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website displaying information in the reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first. It is a platform where a writer or even a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.

    <h2>What is the purpose of a blog?</h2>
            
    <p>There are many reasons to start a blog for personal use and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging. Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has a very straightforward purpose – to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a. increase your visibility.
            
            As a business, you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business, you rely on blogging to help you get to these consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging, your website would remain invisible, whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive.
            
            So, the main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant audience. Another one is to boost your traffic and send quality leads to your website.
            
            The more frequent and better your blog posts are, the higher the chances for your website to get discovered and visited by your target audience. Which means, a blog is an effective lead generation tool. Add a great call to action (CTA), and it will convert your website traffic into high-quality leads. But a blog also allows you to showcase your authority and build a brand.
            
            When you use your niche knowledge for creating informative and engaging posts, it builds trust with your audience. Great blogging makes your business looks more credible, which is especially important if your brand is still young and fairly unknown. It ensures presence and authority at the same time.
            
            Blog structure
            The appearance of blogs changed over time, and nowadays blogs include different items. But, most blogs include some standard features and structure. Here are common features that a typical blog will include:
            
            Header with the menu or navigation bar
            Main content area with highlighted or latest blog posts
            Sidebar with social profiles, favorite content, or call-to-action
            Footer with relevant links like a disclaimer, privacy policy, contact page, etc.

        <h2> Types of Blogging </h2>
        <p>
            There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in the way that content is delivered or written.

            <h5>Personal blogs</h5><p>
The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual, rather than a corporation or organization. While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers, other than the blogger's immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs have become popular, to the point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship. A tiny number of personal bloggers have become famous, both in the online community and in the real world.
</p><h5>Collaborative blogs or group blogs</h5><p>
A type of weblog in which posts are written and published by more than one author.
 The majority of high-profile collaborative blogs are based around a single uniting theme, such as politics, technology or advocacy. 
 In recent years, the blogosphere has seen the emergence and growing popularity of more collaborative efforts, often set up by already established bloggers wishing to pool time and resources, both to reduce the pressure of maintaining a popular website and to attract a larger readership.
</p><h5>Microblogging</h5>
<p>Microblogging is the practice of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links, short videos, or other media—on the Internet. 
    Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users. 
    It has captured the public imagination, in part because the short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting. 
    Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. 
    A wide and growing range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. 
    The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication. 
    Examples of these include Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and, by far the largest, WeiBo.
